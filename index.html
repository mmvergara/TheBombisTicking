                            There are only a few buttons to press for each function/game mode with labels

                            The game is well documented with tutorials and manuals. A bonus is a Github repository you

                            Since the game only needs a single HTML file to run any device that can run an HTML file or access an internet 
                            browser can play the game and also the game is on the website itself.<br><br>

                        The mechanics of the game is pretty intuitive almost everyone knows what happens to a bomb when a number is ticking right beside it,

                        A Manual and a tutorial that only contains a few paragraphs reading those will give the user a full understanding of the game<br><br>

                        <strong>Does the interface look good? </strong>  <br>
                        The game has a bit of an 8-bit theme on it when it comes to text and images and also a minimalistic and straightforward design 
                        with an interactive bird background. For a simple game, I'd give it a 10/10<br><br>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Can the game be played for all people?</strong> <br>
                        The game is free by default you can even modify the game yourself (Game Source Code) and if you can 
                        type you can play the game! <br><br>

                            <strong>Is the design of the game related to its theme of it?</strong>  <br>
                            The Bomb is ticking is a pretty simple game thus giving it an 8bit-game style element will prevail and 
                            add a more nostalgic feel to it
                            while still keeping the pressure element while playing it. <br><br>
                        </p>
            
                        <p>
                            <strong>Does the game have different game modes?</strong>  <br>
                            The game has 2 game modes, First is the classic one where there is a timer in the bomb and you have to score to reset the timer and prevent the bomb from exploding.
                            The second one is to score as much as you can before the bomb explodes in 60seconds! <br><br>
                            </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Does the game sound fit the theme of the game?</strong>  <br>
                            The game has a "pressure" element which uses a gradually accelerating tempo music like the one used on the 60seconds game
                             mode of the game, thus making it a piece of good music for the game along with the metronome ticking sound effect.<br><br>
                            </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>What makes the game fun and addicting to play?</strong>  <br>
                            The game immerses you in the pressure Bomb Squad Technicians feel when defusing a bomb in real life, they are under constant pressure and require a lot of focus to defuse it!
