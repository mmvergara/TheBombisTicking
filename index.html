            immerse you in some way of what <br />
            Bomb Squad Technicians experience when performing their dangerous
            jobs. The user interface only contains few elements <br />
            for you to be able to focus on the game itself you need to match the
            random characters above <br />
            to gain points and reset the timer. Different Gamemodes comes with

            <p>
              <strong>Are the controls/functions hard to navigate?</strong>
              <br />
              There are only a few buttons to press for each function/game mode
              with labels on them for different functions/gamemodes.<br /><br />

                it?</strong
              >
              <br />
              The game is well documented with tutorials and manuals. A bonus is
              a Github repository you can check how the game is made.<br /><br />
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Can the app be installed easily?</strong> <br />
              The game can be played in a single HTML file that you can download
              from this website, it is lightweight and supports many
              platforms.<br /><br />

              <strong

              >
              <br />
              Since the game only needs a single HTML file to run any device
              that can run an HTML file or access an internet browser can play
              the game and also the game is on the website itself.<br /><br />

              >
              <br />
              The only thing you need to play the game is software that can open
              HTML files or a Browser that pretty much everyone has.

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Can absolute beginners play the game?</strong> <br />
              the game considers all types of players there‚Äôs a game mode for
              every type of player ranging from beginners to pros.<br /><br />
            </p>

                >Can the user easily comprehend how to play the game?
              </strong>
              <br />
              The mechanics of the game is pretty intuitive almost everyone
              knows what happens to a bomb when a number is ticking right beside
              it, tutorial anchor link is also available in the game interface
              before playing.<br /><br />
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Can the user learn to use the game easily?</strong> <br />
              A Manual and a tutorial that only contains a few paragraphs
              reading those will give the user a full understanding of the
              game.<br /><br />
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Can the user use the game without much effort?</strong>
              <br />
              The user only needs a keyboard and an internet browser to play the
              game and it is pretty lightweight that you don‚Äôt need a lot of
              processing power to run it.<br /><br />
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Does the game interface looks good? </strong> <br />
              The game has a bit of an 8-bit theme on it when it comes to text
              and images and also a minimalistic and straightforward design with
              an interactive bird background. For a simple game, I'd give it a
              10/10!<br /><br />

              <strong>Can the game be played for all people?</strong> <br />
              The game is free by default you can even modify the game yourself

              <br />
              The Bomb is ticking is a pretty simple game thus giving it an
              8bit-game style element will prevail and add a more nostalgic feel
              to it while still keeping the pressure element while playing it.
              <br /><br />
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Does the game have different game modes?</strong> <br />
              The game has 2 game modes, First is the classic one where there is
              a timer in the bomb and you have to score to reset the timer and
              prevent the bomb from exploding. The second one is to score as
              much as you can before the bomb explodes in 60seconds!
              <br /><br />
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Does the game sound fit the theme of the game?</strong>
              <br />
              The game has a "pressure" element which uses a gradually
              accelerating tempo music like the one used on the 60seconds game
              mode of the game, thus making it a piece of good music for the
              game along with the metronome ticking sound effect.<br /><br />
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>What makes the game fun and addicting to play?</strong>
              <br />
              The game immerses you in the pressure Bomb Squad Technicians feel
              when defusing a bomb in real life, they are under constant
              pressure and require a lot of focus to defuse it!
